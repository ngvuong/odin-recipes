    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Phá»Ÿ, pronounced "fuh," is a Vietnamese soup that is normally made with a
      bone-beef broth, banh pho noodles, and thinly sliced beef, that's often
      served with bean sprouts and other fresh herbs on the side. Not to be
      confused with Japanese ramen, which is usually made with wheat noodles,
      pho is made with rice noodles. It is important to note that there are many
      variations of pho. The most common is pho nam, which originates in
      Southern Vietnam, and pho bac, which is from Northern Vietnam and
      considered to be the original pho.

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until
        browned, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until
        blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large
        stockpot and cover with 4 quarts of water. Bring to a boil and reduce
        heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a
        saucepan and set aside.

      <li>
        Place rice noodles in large bowl filled with room temperature water and
        allow to soak for 1 hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and after

        Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and
        green onion. Pour hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until the

        bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic
        sauce on the side.
